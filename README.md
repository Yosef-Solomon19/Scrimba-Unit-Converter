# Unit Converter link

https://scrimba-passenger-counter-app.netlify.app/

#### Part of the module 3 challenge in the Front-End Career path at Scrimba.

In this project I'll be building a unit converter that will take a number. And provide conversions between imperial and metric in length,volume, and mass.

I'll be adding additional features to this such as:
&ensp; Adding input for the user to change the number and automatically recalculate the value.
&ensp; Adding different conversions such as temperature, and speed

Other potential features to be added in the near future:
&ensp; Display calculation when user clicks on the unit conversion they want ?
