# Unit Converter link

(Link will be provided)

#### Part of Module 3(Making Website Interactive) challenge in the Front-End Career path at Scrimba.

In this solo project I'll be building a unit converter that will take a number. And provide conversions between imperial and metric in length, volume, and mass.

I'll be adding additional features to this such as:

&ensp;&ensp; - [] Adding input for the user to change the number and automatically recalculate the value.\
&ensp;&ensp; - [] Adding different conversions such as temperature, and speed.

Other potential features to be added in the near future:\
&ensp;&ensp; - [] Display calculation when user clicks on the unit conversion they want.
